Viewing with diff the differences between the versions of the file took a while.

I don't have  lot of thoughts on the matter


diff -u file1.txt file2.txt


How could haveing sasy accesss to entire history of file make you a better progeammer?

you can more easily role back to a previous version if you make a mistake. If you wanted to have 
such access 

Reflect manual commits

pros and cons of having versions automatically saved?
too many save points to deal with if you want to revert something


how can you use git log and git diff to view the difference between files?
you use git log to get the commit ids to plug into git diff which shows you the difference


git checkout commitID

how might using version control maek you more confident to make changes to something?
if you know you can find the break more easily and roll back, you are comfortable making changes

How do you want to use git?
I want to use it to become a better programmer

remember that git checkout doesnt always change all the files
